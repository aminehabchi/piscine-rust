# Piscine Rust

Welcome to the **Piscine Rust** repository! This project is a comprehensive learning journey through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the Rust programming language. The term "Piscine" (French for "swimming pool") is inspired by immersive bootcamp-style learning, where the goal is to dive deep and learn by doing.

## What I Learn Here

This repository documents my hands-on exploration of Rust, covering topics such as:

- **Rust Basics:** Variables, data types, functions, control flow, and ownership.
- **Memory Safety:** Understanding Rust’s unique ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes to write safe and efficient code without a garbage collector.
- **Structs & Enums:** Creating and using custom data structures to model complex data.
- **Pattern Matching:** Leveraging `match`, `if let`, and pattern destructuring for expressive and safe code.
- **Error Handling:** Handling recoverable and unrecoverable errors with `Result`, `Option`, and panic mechanisms.
- **Modules & Packages:** Organizing code using modules, crates, and packages for scalability and maintainability.
- **Collections & Iterators:** Working with vectors, hash maps, strings, and iterators for effective data manipulation.
- **Concurrency:** Exploring Rust’s fearless concurrency using threads, channels, and the `async/await` paradigm.
- **Testing:** Writing unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Cargo:** Using Rust's package manager for building, running, and managing dependencies.


## Why Rust?

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Through this Piscine, I aim to:

- Build a solid foundation in Rust’s unique programming concepts.
- Develop robust and efficient software.
- Prepare for real-world Rust projects and contributions to open source.

Happy coding and enjoy the Rust journey!
